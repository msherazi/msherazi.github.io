Hello, my name is Mohammad Sherazi. I am a Physics and Computer Science student at George Mason University, where I am also an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Dr. Fei Wang's research group. My research focuses on developing variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for quantum dynamical simulations. We are hoping to be able to apply these algorithms to problems in quantum chemistry concerning solar cells, semiconductors, as well as in biological molecules. More information can be found in the projects section of the website, and in the GitHub repository.
 
My professional interests lie at the intersection of physics and computer science, especially projects which involve applying optimization techniques and numerical analysis to problems in physics, whether it be quantum computing, orbital dynamics, or simulations of electromagnetic phenomena, among other things.
